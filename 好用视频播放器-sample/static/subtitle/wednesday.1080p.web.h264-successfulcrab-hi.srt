<i>In fact, it's all still happening.</i>

<i>If Isaac's goal is to save his sister,</i>

7
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:32,280
<i>why kidnap Pugsley?</i>

8
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:33,990
[man] All right. Spread out, guys.

9
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:35,826
- You, that way.
- [woman] Pugsley!

No sign of your son.

13
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,087
- [Morticia exhales sharply]
- Any idea why someone would kidnap him?

14
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,881
It's a total mystery, Sheriff.

15
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:51,841
Can you think of anyone
who has a grudge against your family?

16
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,551
Could this be some kind of revenge?

17
00:00:53,552 --> 00:00:56,139
Are you blaming us
for our son's kidnapping?

18
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,015
The search parties
will run through the night.

19
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,143
Parents who were at the gala
have already left with their kids.

20
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,686
All other students will be packed up

21
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,106
and on their way home
by tomorrow afternoon.

22
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,819
I'm sorry. We're doing everything we can.

23
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:14,031
[Morticia] I sent your father and Lurch
out to join the search parties.

24
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:15,406
They won't find Pugsley.

25
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,700
Isaac's too smart.

26
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,704
You need to work together, and to pool
your psychic abilities to locate him.

27
00:01:20,704 --> 00:01:22,873
My mother is a Dove
who's blind to malevolence,

28
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:26,543
and my psychic ability is currently
on an unauthorized leave of absence.

29
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:31,423
That's why you must turn
to the <i>other</i> Raven in your family.

30
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,466
My mother?

31
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:35,343
These are desperate times.

[wry, impish music playing]

33
00:01:44,228 --> 00:01:47,814
Mama, I appreciate you
coming back on such short notice.

34
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,734
Why would anyone
bother kidnapping Pugsley?

35
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:52,944
Not to cast aspersions,

36
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:55,614
but I know higher value corpses
than that boy.

37
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,950
His kidnapper
isn't looking for ransom money.

38
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,912
He's being used as a pawn
to keep us away, or a ploy to draw us in.

39
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:06,626
So many delightful memories of this room.

40
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:10,211
I can still hear
the terrified shrieks of my classmates

41
00:02:10,212 --> 00:02:12,881

Advanced Possession Class.

00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,396
This does require
actual physical connection.

47
00:02:33,777 --> 00:02:37,281
Now we must clear our minds
of all past grievances.

48
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:40,533
My past grievances are like fine wine.
They get better with age.

49
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:41,618
Likewise.

How long do we have to keep this up?

56
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:05,310
Mama! For once just be quiet.
We're trying to find Pugsley.

57
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,103

58
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:10,605

If there was ever a time to unburden
yourself of the truth, now is it.

And for that,

79
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,949
Isaac turned to his best friend.

80
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:27,367
Father.

81
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,000

Hmm.

100
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:51,659
Why cover it up?

101
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,829
Because Augustus Stonehurst threatened us.

102
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:55,997
We knew he built Isaac the lab in secret.

103
00:06:55,997 --> 00:06:58,875
If we breathed a word,
he would've turned us in for murder.

104

No one will ever know we were here.

106
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,343
So you buried Isaac
in the same grave he intended for Father?

107
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:12,932
Yes.

108
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:15,100
Isaac must be trying again.

109
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,394
This time using
Pugsley as the power source.

110
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:20,189
That Addams headstone,
the one I saw in my premonition,

111
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:21,898
must have Pugsley's name on it.

[sighs]

113
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:29,113
I think it's best that you and Thing
go with Grandmama until Pugsley is found.

114
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,992
For once, your mother and I
are in agreement.

[Morticia] These are our sins, Wednesday.

116
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:36,038
We will face them.

I realized that
our breakup wasn't about me.

You know, it's nobody's fault
that your feelings changed.

130

So I can either be angry about it,
or I can just accept it and move on.

Actually, Bianca told me that.

Please tell me that you're done
with lying wolves and beta-gorgons.

137
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:06,753
I put together
a list of potential boyfriends.

138
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:10,298
I already cross-referenced them
based on compatible social media profiles.

139
00:09:10,298 --> 00:09:12,008
Once you've narrowed it down,

140
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,677
I can pay each one an invisible visit.

141
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:17,013
See what they've left out of their bios.

142
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,181
Hmm.

143
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,975
I appreciate the assist,

144
00:09:20,475 --> 00:09:24,104
but I think I'm gonna rip a page
out of the Wednesday Addams playbook

145
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,648
and take a break from romance.

146
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,696
It's not very fun

147
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,823
to be tied up and treated like a pet...

148
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:37,284

00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,121
"Your favorite."

151
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,164
Conserve your energy.

152
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:45,418
You're gonna need it.

153
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,965
I wish I was at least
in one of these pictures.

154
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:57,263
I never understood
your desire for a Normie life.

155
00:09:59,097 --> 00:10:03,269
But... knowing what Stonehurst
did to you in that lab...

156
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,941
Neither of us got
the end that we deserved.

157
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:12,403
That changes tonight.

158
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,823
Promise me,

159
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,743
no matter what happens,

160
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,911
you'll do it.

161
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,913
What we discussed.

162
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:26,375
I need your word.

163
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,674
I made Hyde tracks about 20 miles north
and dropped Pugsley's costume,

164
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,927
then made an anonymous tip like you said.

165
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:40,346
Good, huh?

166
00:10:40,347 --> 00:10:42,890
That'll keep the cops off our trail.

167
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:47,854
Now, it's time to position
your old flame onto the board.

168
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,773
Wednesday will know she's being played.

169
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:53,567
Yeah, an Addams...
would never sacrifice one of their own.

170
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:55,153
Not even a pawn.

171
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,532
And that emotional weakness

172
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,034
will be our checkmate.

173
00:11:02,702 --> 00:11:03,912
[Enid] Any Pugsley update?

174
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,206
Still missing. But he's alive.

175
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:08,375
Isaac is hellbent on saving his sister.

176
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,628
I know he needs Pugsley.
Just need to figure out when and where.

177
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,754
[Agnes] Crap. He's here.

178
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:14,756
Who?

179
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,549
[Enid] Isaac?

180
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,802
No. My dad.

181
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:21,888
He usually sends
some rando assistant to collect me.

182
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,722
Your mom couldn't come get you?

183
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,851
She's busy with
her new Normie husband and baby.

184
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,979
I was the mistake
that kept her and my dad together

185
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,523
long past their sell-by date.

186
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,359
Gunpowder, penicillin, the rack.

187
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,528
Those were all mistakes.

188
00:11:36,986 --> 00:11:39,989
I just want to say that I love us.

189
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,448
We're like the three musketeers.

190
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,450
Careful.

191
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,536
[Agnes's dad] Agnes!

192
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,038
Bye. See you next year.

193
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,915
I wish I could help,
but I have to get to the Lupin cages.

194
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,584
Capri read me the riot act.

195
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,419
Lock in early and stay calm.

196
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,213
So I have my meditation app,
my fave playlist,

197
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,466
and an extra supply of colloidal silver.

200

I'll be there
first thing in the morning to let you out.

201
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,017

204

How long until
your corpse moths are airborne?

205
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,693
Unfortunately,
they're permanently grounded.

206
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,447
Corpse moths only have
a 36-hour life cycle.

207
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,491
Wednesday, I'm really sorry.

208
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,536
Pugsley wanted to be my friend
and I blew him off.

209
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,080
Maybe if I'd been nicer,
he wouldn't have felt the need

210
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,831
to become BFFs with a zombie.

211
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:32,584
I am my brother's keeper.

212
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,793
I simply should have caged him
for his own protection.

213
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:38,130
I'm heading to the Hummer shed.
Have to hibernate my bees early.

I'm on my way to see your parents.

A hiker found Pugsley's costume.

223
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,577
I'm redeploying the search
from Jericho to Burlington.

224
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:10,456
Sounds like a ploy
to draw you off the scent.

225

I follow evidence, not hunches.

226
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,212
Finally, I get my office back.

227
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:22,424
Dort's crashing downfall
has validated my legacy.

228

You covered up Rowan's murder
and the existence of a Hyde.

Mistakes were made.

Slurp was there,

237

He told me to give you this.

Said if I breathe a word to anyone else,
he'd come for me.

240

And now I've witnessed
the havoc you can wreak.

249
00:14:55,476 --> 00:14:58,938
Give me my brother, crawl back
into your hole, and stay dead this time.

250

- Yet I'm the one who died.

Thanks to him and your dear mother.

252
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:09,698
Why don't you let your brother
pay for their mistakes,

253
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,783
and we'll call it even?

254

You don't have the machine.

It would take months to rebuild.

257

didn't kill all of me that night.

Cute.

266

when I saw my right hand

267

wandering the halls
of Willow Hill without me.

268

to take my power from me!

didn't come true after all.

[Isaac] Because of you,

Knowing you were cut from
the literal cloth of an evil genius,

455
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:40,804
it makes sense why we're so compatible.

456

How does it feel
finally knowing the truth?

That you can't control the past.
But the future is in your own hand.

00:36:13,378 --> 00:36:14,630
[Wednesday] That's Enid.

463
00:36:16,715 --> 00:36:18,925

465
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:23,346
Was she able to provide intel
that could tell us where Enid is going?

466
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,764
She's MIA.

467
00:36:24,764 --> 00:36:27,099

the world can't find them.

the need for a single master.

483

over the break, if you're not too busy,

493
00:38:06,074 --> 00:38:07,659
you could come for a visit?

494
00:38:08,827 --> 00:38:10,871
Really? To your actual house?

495
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,331

496
00:38:18,003 --> 00:38:19,170

in regaining your psychic ability.

I'm taking a well-deserved sabbatical.

to keep my spirit alive would be you?
